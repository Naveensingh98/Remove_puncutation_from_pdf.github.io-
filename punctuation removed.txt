Praise for the first edition
 Head First Python
 is a great introduction to not just the Python language  but Python as it s used in the 
real world  The book goes beyond the syntax to teach you how to create applications for Android phones  
Google s App Engine  and more  

 Where other books start with theory and progress to examples  
Head First Python
 jumps right in with code and explains the theory as you read along 
 This is a much more effective learning environment  because 
it engages the reader to 
do
 from the very beginning  It was also just a joy to read  
 It was fun without 
being flippant and informative without being condescending  The breadth of examples and explanation 
covered the majority of what you ll use in your job every day  I ll recommend this book to anyone
